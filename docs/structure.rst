Overview
========

Sunbeam is a snakemake pipeline with a python library acting as a wrapper. 
Calling `sunbeam [cmd] [args] [options]` is a call to this wrapper library 
which then invokes the necessary snakemake commands. The main Snakefile can be 
found in the root directory and it makes use of rules from `rules/` and 
`extensions/`, scripts from `scripts/`, and environments from `envs/`. Tests 
are managed by a script `tests/run_tests.bash` which collects test 
functions from `tests/test_suite.bash`. Documentation lives in `docs/` and is 
served by ReadTheDocs.

Sections
========

sunbeam/ (root directory)
-------------------------

The root sunbeam directory holds a few important files including 
`environment.yml`, `setup.py`, and `Snakefile`. The environment file defines 
the dependencies required to run sunbeam and is used to create the main sunbeam 
environment. The setup file defines the structure and dependencies of the 
sunbeamlib_ and makes it installable via pip. The snakefile manages all of the 
snakemake components of the pipeline.

.. tip::

    `environment.yml` defines the main sunbeam environment that you activate in 
    order to run the pipeline. Internally, sunbeam then manages a number of 
    other environments (defined in envs_) on a per-rule basis.

docs/
-----

Each page of the sunbeam documentation is here in the form of a `.rst` file. 
The additional files are all involved in the setup and deployment of the docs 
to ReadTheDocs using Sphinx. Most of these are autogenerated by Sphinx. The one 
bit of trickiness comes from importing the version of sunbeam into the docs 
build. This is done in `conf.py` by adding the sunbeam root to `sys.path` and 
then importing `sunbeamlib` which stores the version tag in a `__version__` 
variable using `semantic_version`.

.. _envs:
envs/
-----

This directory contains `.yml` files defining environments that will be managed 
by snakemake as it runs. Anywhere that a rule is defined with 
`conda: /path/to/ENV_NAME.yml`, when snakemake reaches that rule, that 
environment will be created if it doesn't exist already and then activated 
while running the rule. These environments are created in `sunbeam/.snakemake/` 
by default.
